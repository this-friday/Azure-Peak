//   Mapper-placed flavor grass (grassred/grassyel/grasscold) keeps its own identity year-round
//   but still swaps to snow in Winter (see winter_type/summer_type below).
// - Flora: tree canopy leaf objects/overlays swap sprites via apply_flora_season().
// - Water: turfs with freeze_type gain/lose an ice layer in Mid/Late Winter via PlaceOnTop()/
//   ScrapeAway(), which lets the original water subtype ride along on baseturfs.
// - Paths: dirt/dirt-road/cobble/cobblerock (anything with winter_type set) ChangeTurf() into a
//   Winter sibling turf rather than an icon swap, since dirt carries per-instance state a bare
//   icon swap can't safely coexist with. See apply_season_to_path().
// - Decals: map-placed decorative decals with a winter_icon_state get a direct icon_state swap.
